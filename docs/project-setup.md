### Create a fork

First things first we need to create a fork of the SaveIT repository `TerrestrialSoft/SaveIT`.

Forks allows us to propose changes and after that create a pull request to submit changes to an original repository.

1. Click on the button **Fork** located in the upper right corner under the page header with your profile picture.
1. Deselect **Copy the `main` branch only** option
1. Click **Create fork** 
    - This will create a copy of SaveIT repository in your profile.

So now you have a remote copy of `SaveIT` repository.

> More information about forking a repository in [Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)

### Cloning the Fork

For now the fork only exists remotely. We need to download it (clone it) in order to be able to work on it on our computer.

1. Navigate to your forked repository
1. Click on **Code** button located next to the **About section** in the right.
1. Select one of the options to clone. (SSH is highly preferable option. More about SSH cloning [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
1. Copy the the link to your remote repository
1. Open terminal on your local machine
1. Navigate to a folder where the project should be cloned to
1. type `git clone` and paste your **repository link**
    - For example: `git clone git@github.com:TheSecurity/SaveIT.git`
